There are lot of challenges are there in setting up an load balancer for an application over the cluster.
1. provisioning the required infrastructure and installing and configuring the load balancer manually takes lot of time
2. to host and route the traffic to an application on the cluster, we need to configure servergroups and enable path-based routing at the load balancer level, which is highly complex job
3. each time there is a change in the servergroup dues to an node went down, the ops engineer has to identify and modify LBR configuration which is an recurring and maintainance job
4. need to enable healthchecks to determine faulty nodes and stop routing the traffic
5. need to configure or enable SSL on the Load balancer which is an difficult job
6. if the loadbalancer itself is down, the application availability becomes zero. so need to host the load balancers based on HA configuration
7. to enable HA and Fault Tolerant the ops engineer has to configure sticky session and session replication which is complex things to achieve

Looking at the above we can understand provisioning, installing, configuring and maintaining the load balancer manually seems to be an difficult job instead we can use AWS Cloud Loadbalancers
