Cloud computing
on-demand delivery of computing resources to the external world is called "Cloud Computing". There are 3 different types of services offered by cloud providers
#1. IAAS
#2. PAAS
#3. SAAS

#1. IAAS = stands for infrastructure as a service, all the computing and infrastructure resources required for hosting and running an software application is provided as part of IAAS.
The lifecycle activities like
1. provisioning
2. deprovisioning
3. backup
4. restore
5. scale-out
6. scale-in
7. scale-up
8. scale-down
are taken care by cloud provider

The advantages of cloud over data center or other hosting platforms
1. flexibile shapes
2. no up-front cost/contractual signups or agreement in leasing the infra/compute services
3. pay per usage

#2. PAAS
PAAS stands for platform as a service. For our applications to execute or run on a machine we need the language software or application servers to be available. unless otherwise our applications will not run on the underlying machine.
	
The softwares that acts as a base/foundation on which the applications softwares run ontop of them are called "platform softwares" for eg..
	1. all the language softwares
		1.1 java sdk
		1.2 python sdk
		1.3 php sdk
		etc
	2. all the application servers or middlewares on which our applications work
		1.1 tomcat/weblogic/websphere servers etc
		1.2 wsgi/asgi servers
		1.3 lamp / xamp server etc
		
	3. database servers like
		3.1 mysql server
		3.2 postgres sql server
		3.3 oracle
		etc
unless these softwares are installed/configured on the compute instances, our applications cannot be deployed. 
The business organization has to hire a team of system administrators, who takes care of procuring licencse, installing, configuring and managing these platform software
