subnet
subnet is a sub-network out of an vpc network to enforce traffic/security restrictions on a group of resources

1. subnets are scoped to the availability zone
2. at max we can create 200 subnets within an vpc
3. it is recommended to create atleast 2 subnets across the availability zones of an vpc to distribute the resources

There are 2 main reasons for using an subnet
1. to distribute resources across the availability zones of an vpc in an region
2. to enforce traffic restrictions/security on different groups of resources

we might need to create multiple subnets within the availability zone for enforcing different security restrictions on different group of resources

There are 3 types of subnets are there
1. private subnet
2. public subnet
3. hybrid subnet

#1. private subnet
by default when we create a subnet within the availability zone of a vpc within a region, the subnet becomes private subnet only, which means the resources within the private subnet cannot be accessible from external network.
only the resources within the vpc across the subnets can communicate with each other
