What is NACL, why do we need to use it?
NACL stands for network access control list, it is a firewall configured at the subnet level to enforce traffic restrictions on the group of resources of a subnet
1. By default when we create an vpc and subnets, the aws cloud platform creates default nacl rules for all the subnets of the vpc
2. Through the help of NACL rules we can enforce traffic restrictions on the subnet of resources based on
	1. source cidr
	2. protocol
	3. port
	allow/deny the network traffic to the resources
3. NACL rules are stateless
		1. Stateless refers to the request and response are treated separately. NACL Engine doesnt keep track of a request to identify and allow the response for that request. so we need to separately configure inbound/oubound rules in allowing the network traffic in both the directions
    2. To allow network traffic in both the directions we need to configure separately 
			- Ingress = refers to the rules to applied in allowing the in-bound network traffic
			- Egress = refers to the rules to be applied for allowing the network traffic from subnet of resources to the external network traffic
4. NACL rules are ordered, which means each rule is given an priority or sequenceno in which the rules has to be applied.
