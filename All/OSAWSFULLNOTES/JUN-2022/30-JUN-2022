cloud computing
on demand delivery of computing services to the world is called "cloud computing". As part of the cloud computing there are 3 types of services are provided.	
1. IAAS = infrastructure as a service
2. PAAS = platform as a service
3. SAAS = software as a service


#1. IAAS 
IAAS stands for infrastructure as a a service. all the computing resources required for hosting/running an software application are provided as part of IAAS.	For eg..
	1. compute instance (computer) (operating system platform)
	2. network resources 
		2.1 gateways
		2.2 firewalls
		2.3 subnets
		2.4 private networks
	3. ip adresses
	4. storage (network storage, additional storage backup) 
	5. load balancers
	6. dns resgistries
	7. dns services

virtualization technology
virtualization technology is used for creating multiple parallel isolated environments on a physical computer system

If we look at the above IAAS is merely looks like an data center, but there are lot of benefits are there
1. The shape of the machines that can choosen in procuring the infrastructure is flexible we can compose the configuration of the machine with which we want to procure the resources
