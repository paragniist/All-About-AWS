How many ways we can extend the storage capacity for an ec2 instance?
There are 2 ways are there
1. extending the storage capacity by provisioning and attaching an additional storage volume
2. expanding the root volume

#1. extending the storage capacity by provisioning and attaching an additional storage volume

1. create an additional ebs volume with required capacity and add to existing ec2 instance
2. run any one of the below commands to identify the block device that is newly attached to the ec2 instance
lsblk
fdisk -l

the newly created volume will be found under /dev/xvdf 

3. mount the new device onto the operating system
sudo mkfs /dev/xvdf
sudo mkdir /ext 
sudo mount /dev/xvdf /ext

to make the mount volume permanent add an entry into /etc/fstab

UUID=482332bb-cda5-49ea-bd86-2b1b609c5640   /exthdd   ext4     defaults 0 2
or
/dev/xvdf       /exthdd          ext4   defaults 0  2

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#2. expanding the root volume
1. take an snapshot of existing root ebs volume
2. create an new ebs volume of required capacity from the snapshot
3. stop the existing ec2 instance
4. detach the root volume
5. attach new ebs volume provisioned from the ebs volume page, while attaching the ebs volume give the devicename as /dev/sda1
6. start ec2 instance

What are the ebs volume types are there?
Root supported volume types:
1. General Purpose SSD gp2
2. General Purpose SSD gp3
---------------------------
3. Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1)
4. Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2)
-----------------------------
5. Magnetic Storage (sata) (aws deprecated)

additional ebs volumes we can use 2 more types are
1.cold ssd (low transfer rathes) (low price) (doesnt support frequent access of data)
2. ThroughPut optimized HDD
