How many ways we can access an EFS location?
There are 2 ways are there
1. using mount targets
2. access points

#1. mount targets
we can access the efs location by mouting the mountTarget onto the ec2 instances within the vpc, through mountTargets we have
1. access to the root filesystem of the EFS
2. all the operations we perform on the efs location will be performed on the root user


#2. access points
access points help the application easily accessing the efs location. For each application we create an separate access point dedicating a directory. 
per application we create an linux user and configure in access point to perform operations on efs location through the application user. 
advantages:
1. every application will perform operations on their dedicated directory location on the efs location, so no chance of 2 different applications overlapping the data of each other
2. security, not 2 different applications can see or access others data
3. multiple instances of the application can access the accesspoint through the same user
