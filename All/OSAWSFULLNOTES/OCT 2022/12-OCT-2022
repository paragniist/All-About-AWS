when do we use scale-up/scale-down?
if the computing resources required for running our application has been increased, it could be due to several reasons like
1. change in underlying platform version
2. patch/upgradation of a software
3. new version of the application released which might need more resources
then inorder to run the application with increased capacity we need to use scaleup, in otherway to decreases the computing capacity we need to use scale-down

when do we use scale-out/scale-in?
if the enduser traffic in accessing the application has been increased, to meet the demand of the users we need to use scale-out, so that the traffic  can be evenly distributed across multiple resources on which the application is running, viceversa if the traffic goes down we can release a resource using scale-in
