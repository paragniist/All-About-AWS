#2 Network loadbalancer
Network loadbalancer works at layer4 of the OSI Model, the transport layer does 3 responsibilities
1. segmentation
2. flow control
3. error control

at the transport layer we have protocol being used in exchanging the data, ip address and the portno of the application to whom the data has to be send.
So the network balancer loadbalance or routes the requests based on protocol and portno of the application rather than URL. Ideally suitable for the back-end applications that works on TCP or UDP or FTP protocol

Application loadbalancer can be also called as Http loadbalancer, because it works especially for load balancing the requests of http/https applications only, whereas to loadbalance the requests across non-http based application we need to network loadbalancer

Network loadbalancer helps us in distributing the load of backend servers to group of machines for scalability and high availability
Let us explore the differences between Application load balancer and Network loadbalancer to understand them better

#1
Application loadbalancer
For an Application loadbalancer, the aws cloud platform will not provide elastic public ip address, rather it generates an DNS Name using which we need to access the loadbalancer

Network loadbalancer
We can associate the network loadbalancer with an ip address in addition to the dns name 

#2
Application loadbalancer
it works only for http/https protocol only for routing/loadbalancing the requests across the applications. it supports various conditional routes based on http protocol
2.1 Path-based Routing
2.2 Hostname
2.3 Header
2.4 Http Method
2.5 Query Parameter
and supports sticky sessions and session replication as well

Network loadbalancer
it works for any TCP/UDP or other network protocols and only supports protocol & port based routing only to the backend applications
