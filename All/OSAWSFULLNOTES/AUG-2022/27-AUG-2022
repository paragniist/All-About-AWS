How does no-sql databases stores the data?
There is no standard format in storing the data by the no-sql databases, different database products stores the data in different format but we can generalize and can understand.
since no-sql database supports storing semi-structured data where each record may not have all the columns of data so these databases will not store the data in structured tables

rather these databases stores the data in collections. In each collection we store doc/record of information where each record has a varied key/value pair of data

In case of mongodb it supports storing the data interms of docs in a collection. each doc is stored in json format represent a record of information
Cassendra is called columnar database which supports storing the data in key/value pair

In addition to the above aws cloud platform has provided dynamodb as an no-sql database management system.

DynamoDb
--------
There are plenty of advantages of using dynamodb when compared with other no-sql databases available in the market
1. DynamoDb is an managed service that is hosted by the aws cloud platform which takes care of all the lifecycle operations like provisioning/de-provisioning, scaleup/scaledown, scale-out/scale-in, backup/restore etc. if we are using any of the third-party provider databases, these has to be manually takencare by the ops engineer which is quite complex and huge cost in managing
2. Optimized for performance at scale = irrespecitve of amount of data being stored in the DynamoDb database we can achieve same level of consistency interms of performance while accessing the data from the database
3. High Availability / Durability = no matter always the database is available and the data is durable without loss
4. Integrate with other AWS Services
5. Cost effective usage based payment model
